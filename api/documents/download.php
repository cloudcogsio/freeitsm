/**
 * API Endpoint: fetch a document.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS THE BOUNDARY. Everything else in the feature decides what to LIST;
 * this decides what somebody may HAVE. It must never assume the caller found the
 * id through a filtered list — `download.php?id=12345` with a guessed integer is
 * the attack, and integers are easy to guess.
 *
 * So the check here is the full one: documentCanView() walks every link and asks
 * whether the caller can see any parent. It is deliberately the expensive form,
 * because N is 1 and being right matters more than being quick.
 *
 * Every successful fetch is recorded. This is the only route to a document, so
 * it is the only place that can honestly claim to have seen every access.
